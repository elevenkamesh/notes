- `io.ReadAll()` reads every Reader and converts it to bytes
- We can convert these bytes by using `json.Unmarshal(data []byte, v any)`, it parses the JSON-encoded data and stores the result in the value pointed to by v. If v is nil or not a pointer, Unmarshal returns an InvalidUnmarshalError.
- We can convert a `map` or anything to JSON bytes using `json.Marshal(v any)`, it returns the JSON encoding of v. Basically then we can convert it using `string(data []byte)` to convert it to a string
