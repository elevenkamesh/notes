When developing with Node.js, there are several best practices to keep in mind:

- Use asynchronous APIs: Node.js is designed with asynchronous event-driven architecture. By using asynchronous APIs, you can get the most out of the Node.js design and avoid blocking the event loop.
- Use the Express.js framework: Express.js is the most popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a simple way to manage routes, requests, and views.
- Handle errors properly: Error handling is crucial in any application. In Node.js, errors can be handled using middleware and by logging the errors for debugging.
- Use environment variables: Environment variables are a great way to configure your application based on the environment where it's running.
- Write tests: Good test coverage is essential for maintaining code quality and catching bugs before they reach production. Use testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest for this purpose.
- Use a linter: A linter like ESLint will help you catch errors before they become problems and enforce a consistent coding style.
