- A script which automatically syncs obsidian vault to GitHub
- Runs every day to update the repo if there are any changes in the vault
- Why not a cron job ?
	- for a cron job we'll have to keep the server running all the times. instead writing a script and running it automatically as soon as the machine starts, will make more sense
