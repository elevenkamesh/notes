## What are bind mounts ?
When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine. By contrast, when you use a [[Docker Volumes|volume]], a new directory is created within Docker's storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory's contents.
The file or directory does not need to exist on the Docker host already. It is created on demand if it does not yet exist. Bind mounts are very performant, but they rely on the host machine's filesystem having a specific directory structure available. We can't use docker CLI commands to directly manage bind mounts.
