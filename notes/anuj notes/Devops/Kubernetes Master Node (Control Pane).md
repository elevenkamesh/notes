## API Server
- **Handling Restful API requests:** This processes and responds to API requests from various clients and `kubectl` CLI tool, other Kubernetes components and external applications. These requests involve CRUD operations on Kubernetes resources such as pods, services and deployments.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** This manages auth of all API requests. Only authenticated and authorized users can perform operations on the cluster.
- **Metrics & Health Checks:** Exposes metrics and health check endpoints to monitor and diagnose the health and perf of control pane.
- **Communication Hub:** Acts as central communication hub for the kubernetes control pane. Every component interacts with this to retrieve and update the state of cluster.
## etcd
Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
## Kube-Scheduler
Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on. Its responsible for pod placement and deciding which pod goes on which node.
## Kube-Controller-Manager
Component of the control pane that runs a set of controllers, each of which is responsible to manage a particular aspect of the state of the cluster. Some examples of controllers are:
- **Node controller:** Notices and responds when nodes go down.
- **Deployment Controller:** Watches for newly created or updated deployments and manages ReplicaSets based on deployment specifications. Ensures that desired state of deployment is maintained by creating or scaling ReplicaSets as needed.
- **ReplicaSet Controller:** Watches for newly created or updated ReplicaSets & ensures that desired number of pod replicas are running at any given point of time. It creates or deletes pods to maintain the specified number of Replicas in the ReplicaSetâ€™s configuration
